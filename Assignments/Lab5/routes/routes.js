    "My name is Mitchell and I am currently in my 8th semester of Computer Engineering studying at Stevens Institute of Technology. Throughout my 8 semesters, I have taken courses in computer programming, electrical engineering, as well as general engineering.\nIn addition to my studies, I also currently work as an E-Commerce IT Technician at Conair LLC in the IT department assisting with e-commerce and IT projects. The scope of my work can vary widely, but normally consists of working with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and managing our external development teams to facilitate the creation of new sites, feature requests	, and bug fixes. Working full time and going to school full time has been a challenge, but who isn't up for a good challenge?",

  story:
    "The day was February 27th, 2023. The weather was cold, with lows in the 30s and highs nearing 40, and an impending snow storm was slated to start in the evening. A local subcontractor, let's name him Joe as he has not been publically named and shamed yet, was doing his job as he normally would for the energy company PSE&G. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, until Joe got a little too heavy handed and struck a water main in the late morning. What a f*****g idiot. With that one strike, most of the city of Hoboken lost access to running water.\nNot too long after, as more and more people begin to notice and start to think about what could possibly be going on, the city sent out an email update. In every effort to save face, they made sure to keep reminding us in almost all communications that this was caused by 'private construction', and that it 100% has nothing to do with the actions of the city. The city then proceeded to take well over 24 hours to 'isolate the exact location of the break', which any schmuck with eyes could have done since THERE WAS WATER GUSHING OUT OF THE GROUND WHERE THEY WERE DIGGING THAT DAY. The city also made sure to keep reminding the public that the fire department had a tank of water that people could use. This water, while not safe to put in your mouth and swallow, was apparently perfectly fine for 'dishwashing' and cleaning your utensils which would then touch all the food you are about to put in your mouth and swallow.\nOn the evening of February 28th, 2023, the break was finally located, and repairs began. As of the evening of March 1st, 2023, the city has running water again, but is under a boil order as the water is not safe to consume. Pray for Hoboken.",
